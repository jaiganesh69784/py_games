    "This Python script measures your reaction speed. It counts down from 3 to 1, then prompts you to press Enter. After a random delay, it displays \"Press ENTER now!\" and waits for your response. It then calculates your reaction time and categorizes it as fast, average, slow, or terrible based on predefined thresholds. Give it a try and see how quick you are!"
